# 🧠 Pneumonia Detection from Scratch

This project implements a binary image classifier to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images — built **completely from scratch** using only NumPy, without high-level ML libraries.

It is part of a series of learning projects inspired by [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Data loading and preprocessing using Pillow & NumPy
- ✅ Flattening and normalization of grayscale images
- ✅ Train/Test split for evaluation (no sklearn)
- 🛠️ Prediction function (to be implemented)
- 🔜 Neural network implementation coming soon

> ⚠️ This is a **learning lab**, not a production-ready model. The focus is on understanding the full machine learning pipeline manually.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is a small subset of a pneumonia detection dataset containing X-ray images for two classes:
- `PNEUMONIA`
- `NORMAL`

👉 You can use a mini-version or sample 500–1000 images from:
- [Kaggle Chest X-Ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## 🚧 To Be Continued

This project is still in progress.

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement a convolutional neural network from scratch
- [ ] Hyperparameters tuning
- [ ] Decrease the training cost
- [ ] Add visualizations of predictions

> 📘 Future updates will apply concepts learned in Week 4 and beyond of the Deep Learning Specialization.
